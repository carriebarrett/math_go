# Math GO!

A blatant knock-off of Poke-something GO. But for education purposes!

Mobile educational game for iOS or Android.

Granular Requirements:
>>Users wander around picking up beasties shown on their screen (AR).
>>
>>Beasties are randomly placed in the real world (lat/lon).
>>
>>GPS guides the user to the Beastie, just like that famous app that will not be named.
>>
>>The mobile device compass further adds to the realism.
>>
>>To capture a Beastie, the user must correctly answer a math question (K-8).
>>
>>Correct and the Beastie is captured, Incorrect and it is set free (maybe unavailable for a period of time).
>>
>>Questions are randomly assigned to a Beastie on the fly (maybe).
